\subsubsection{Suite}\label{Testing:About:Suite}
	In this section we will talk about the testing suite and how it works and what is does.
	
	Since we chose to do most of our testing on NS3 using the MobiEmu\footnote{A framework for emulating mobile ad-hoc networks with Linux containers and ns-3. \url{https://code.google.com/p/mobiemu/}} framework most of our tests are fully automated. As we have not manage to integrate everything into the testing framework some variables are still static, but these will be highlighted where applicable.

	\begin{shaded}
	Please refer to appendix \ref{Mobiemu Setup Guide} for instruction to setup the testing framework. And for a description of the different variables in the test.
