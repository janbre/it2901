\subsubsection{Test Service}\label{Testing:About:Service}
    In this section we will shortly describe the test service used for testing, \ref{attachment?}"EchoServiceLargeReply.war".
    % TODO: fix ref.

    The test service is very simple and deployable with GlassFish. It expects a request like this:
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{TestServiceRequest}
        \label{fig:TestServiceRequest}
    \end{figure}
    \\
    And responds like this:
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{TestServiceResponse}
        \label{fig:TestServiceResponse}
    \end{figure}
    \\
    With PAYLOAD intact, and 10Kb of Lorem Ipsum\footnote{\URL{http://www.lipsum.com/} - simply dummy text}. We add these 10Kb's of text to ensure that the response is considerably larger than the request, which should get us more realistic results when testing. We also sends the original payload back so the test client can easily identify which request was responded to.
