\section{Result Parsing}\label{Result Parsing}
    In this apendix we will describe how to use the scripts provided to parse the results we get from testing with MobiEmu.
    
    If tests are run with different bandwidth capacities we can use the script GroupResults.py like this:
    \lstset{language=bash}
    \begin{lstlisting}
$ python2 GroupResults.py /path/to/results/ /path/to/where/you/want/results/grouped/
    \end{lstlisting}
    This script will move the results from the first folder to the second, and group them in subfolders with the name of their bandwidth capacities. When choosing a folder to move them to we recommend choosing a subfolder of a general results folder, this way you can use the script parseall.sh like this:
    \begin{lstlisting}
$ python2 parseall.sh /path/to/folder/containing/the/folder/you/moved/results/to/
    \end{lstlisting}
