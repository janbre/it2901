\section{Design and Implementation}\label{Design and Implementation}
	In this section we will discuss the design and implementation of the whole system. First of is the section about the client side of the equation and then follows the server side. 
	
	Below is a first taste of how our system works. In figure \ref{fig:totaloverview} you can see a cloud of clients which can be on the same local network or be on different networks. The \textit{ESB} talks to \textit{GlassFish} where services are placed and clients talk to the ESB which mediates the message into GlassFish. In order for the ESB to know how much bandwidth each client can utilize, it is dependent on the \textit{Monitoring Service} which relays that sort of network information.

    \subsection{Changes}\label{Changes}
        There are a lot of changes from the initial prestudy design to the final design described in this chapter. The prestudy design did not go into a lot of detail because of limited knowledge about the systems we were to be using. Some assumptions made proved to be wrong, and a lot of difficulties popped up along the way. But the overall design has remained relatively similar. In this chapter we will describe some of the changes made along the way, both for the Client and the Server. This can help you get a better understanding of some of our discoveries, and maybe why we ended up with the product we now have.
