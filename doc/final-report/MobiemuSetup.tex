\section{Mobiemu Setup Guide}\label{Mobiemu Setup Guide}
In this appendix we will show you how to setup the Mobiemu framework to make it ready to run the tests from Chapter \ref{Testing}.

We will start by downloading NS3 which is required in order to run our tests. Just download NS3 from \url{http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.13.tar.bz2} in order to get the same version as we are using and then follow the instructions at \url{http://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.13/tutorial/html/getting-started.html#building-ns-3} in order to build and let NS3 configure it self.

Since this framework is quite nice and packages up everything before a system test all we need to do is unpack one of our run folders and we should be good to go. We have included a compressed folder which contains five compressed folders where each of these contains a test which we need to unpack in order to run.

After you have unpacked on of these tests we only have to add the ESB and GlassFish to be able to run the tests.

We will assume that you have unpacked on of our tests and created a folder named “system-test” which contains the whole experiment.

\begin{shaded}
In order to do the next part you will need to have setup the ESB with our changes, if you have not done so, please see appendix \ref{Server Setup Guide}
\end{shaded}

\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={Copy ESB and GlassFish into System test}, label=mobiemu:copy esb, breaklines=true]
$ cd /path/to/system-test/experiments/esb/
$ cp /path/to/esb/bin/ bin
$ cp /path/to/esb/dbscripts/ dbscripts
$ cp /path/to/esb/lib/ lib
$ cp /path/to/esb/repository/ repository
$ cp /path/to/esb/samples/ samples
$ cp /path/to/esb/tmp/ tmp

$ cd ..
$ cp /path/to/glassfish/ glassfish
\end{lstlisting}

Now we just have to add the testing client.
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={Adding the test client}, label=mobiemu:adding test client, breaklines=true]
$ cd /path/to/system-test/experiments/
$ mkdir EchoClient
$ cp /path/to/EchoClientClient.jar EchoClient/
\end{lstlisting}

Now we need to just copy the file “synapse.xml” into the correct folder and we should be good to go. Copy the “synapse.xml” file from the folder you unpacked into “/path/to/system-test/experiments/esb/repository/deployment/server/synapse-configs/default/”. This will ensure that the ESB is configured correctly with the same timeout as we have run with.

You may also need to change the path in “system-test-2.py” please have a look at \ref{mobiemu:system-test-2.py changes} and change it to reflect your setup.

The last thing we need to do is just edit the settings file and ensure that the “[ns3]” section points to the right path. In listing \ref{mobiemu:setting.cfg} we have included our setting file, which is configured the way we set things up. Just edit the path under “[ns3]” to point to your path to NS3.

Now the setup should be completed and it should now be possible to run the framework. In order to do so just run:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={Run Mobiemu}, label=mobiemu:run, breaklines=true]
$ cd /path/to/system-test
$ sudo su
# ./run.py run
\end{lstlisting}

You will now be running one of our system tests!\\

The rest of this appendix will explain the different variables and testing files that we use in our setup, it is not necessary to read this section if you just want to verify our tests.

Below is the full settings files for all of our system test, the comments within it is from the Mobiemu creator, but we will try to explain them all and highlight the ones which has a real effect on our tests.

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={Setting.cfg}, label=mobiemu:setting.cfg, breaklines=true]
#
# This configuration file contains the parameters for the experiments run by run.py.
#
# When an experiment starts, scripts are executed in the following order (for each repetition):
#
# 1. Scripts specified in config.init_scripts are executed
# 2. Virtual network devices are created
# 3. ns-3 is started
# 4. One lxc-container is started for each node in the experiment
# 2. In lxc: Any modules specified in the experiment are executed in parallell
# 3. In lxc: Wait for config.initial_wait
# 5. In lxc: Start experiment script
# 6. In lxc: Wait for config.experiment_wait
# 7. In lxc: Wait for config.shutdown_wait / 2. If the experiment is still running, attempt to kill it.
# 8. In lxc: Stop all modules
#
# This is repeated for every repetition of the experiment. Note that multiple experiments may be executed
# by separating them by a "," in the configuration.
#
# When run.py is run without parameters it attempts to estimate the total time it will take to execute
# the current configuration.
#
# Modules and experiment-scripts are passed all parameters in their configuration and in the general-section as environment variables.

The most important variables and their meaning is described below.

\begin{itemize}
\item total\_nodes=4 - This is the total number of nodes in the testing, this variable is passed to NS3 so it can use it and setup the right amount of nodes. Since we don’t have dynamic tests this should be coordinated with the NS3 topology.
\item initial\_random\_seed=31 - This seed is passed to all scripts which use random variables. In our testing we have no random variables so this should not be of great importance.
\item repetitions=10 - The number of repetitions for each test. In our setup this means 10 repetitions for each bandwidth.
\item experiment\_duration=600 - Total duration for the experiment, this must be coordinated with the “system-test-2.py” file you can see in \ref{mobiemu:system-test-2.py}.
\item dataRate=1KBps,5KBps,10KBps,20KBps,40KBps - These are the different datarates that the experiment is run with. Each of these will be repeated “repetition” number of times.
\item experiment=system\_test\_2.py - This is the experiment in “experiments” to run, please see \ref{mobiemu:system-test-2.py} for more information.
\end{itemize}

Next we will take a look at our testing file. This file is what starts the ESB, GlassFish and each of the clients. It is run inside its own LXC and as such needs to check which node it is so as to start the right application.

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={System-test-2.py}, label=mobiemu:system-test-2.py, breaklines=true]
#!/usr/bin/env python

from os import getenv
from subprocess import Popen
from time import sleep

node_id = int(getenv('node_id'))
path = '/home/qos/server/mobiemu/system-test-2/experiments/'
gfSleep = 60
wso2Sleep = 190
experimentSleep = 320

#Since node 2 is a "router" node we don't do anything there
if node_id == 1:
   #This is the ESB/GlashFish node
   #Start GlashFish:
   print 'Starting GlashFish'
   gf = Popen(['{0}glassfish/bin/./startserv'.format(path)])
   #Wait for glassfish to start
   sleep(gfSleep)
   #Start ESB
   print 'Starting WSO2'
   wso2 = Popen(['{0}esb/bin/./wso2server.sh'.format(path)])
   #Need to sleep to wait for experiment to finish
   sleep(wso2Sleep + experimentSleep)    
   print 'Done with experiment, terminating GlashFish and WSO2'
   wso2.kill()
   gf.terminate()
elif node_id == 2 or node_id == 3 or node_id == 4:
   #This is the client node
   #Need to wait for GF and WSO2 to start
   print 'Starting node 3, EchoClientClient'
   sleep(gfSleep + wso2Sleep)
   echo = Popen(['java', '-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true', '-jar', '{0}EchoClient/EchoClientClient.jar'.format(path), '{0}client_{1}.config'.format(path, node_id - 1)])
   sleep(experimentSleep)
   #Check if echo has terminated,
   #poll() returns None if it hasn't terminated
   echo.poll()
   if not echo.returncode:
       #Client has most likely crashed at this point
       #as such we need to kill it, softly with this song...
       echo.terminate()
\end{lstlisting}

There should really be nothing to special about this file. It first starts up GlassFish and then the ESB, each client sleeps until the ESB has started and then they start sending their messages.

\begin{itemize}\label{mobiemu:system-test-2.py changes}
\item path = '/home/qos/server/mobiemu/system-test-2/experiments/' - This will need to be changed to reflect where it is run from, this has to be this way because it is run with root and it needs an absolute path.
\end{itemize}

The last file we will look at is the topology file, this defines the topology in NS3 and creates Tap-Bridges which we connect the LXCs to.

There should be very little here which needs explaining, as NS3 in itself is quite complex. Therefore we refer you to the NS3\footnote{Documentation for NS3 \url{http://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.13/tutorial/singlehtml/index.html}} documentation if you would like extend the topology.
