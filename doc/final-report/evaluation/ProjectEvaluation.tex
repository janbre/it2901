\section{Project Evaluation}\label{Project Evaluation}
    During this last chapter before the conclusion we will try to take a step back and look at the project. We will try to criticize were that is appropriate and give our self a pat on the back when that is in order. We hope that after reading this you will understand the problems we have faced, where we have gone wrong and hopefully we can point out how we should have avoided those problems. This chapter then will work as a summary over the process.
