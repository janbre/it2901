% we might have been a bit slow to get to the coding part but it worked out well(?). 
% did we complete implementation on time?

Because of all the research needed for this project we planned to start the development phase relatively late in the project. And we did manage to start it at the planned time.

On the server side of the project we quickly saw that most of the implementation would take less time than originally anticipated. That way we could start looking at the test suite earlier as well. However on the client side things went a little slower, so we put in more work hours to complete it in time. 

Work on the Identity Server and OpenSAML did not go as planned. The IS was very badly documented, and alot of work hours was put into something that in the end was dropped. OpenSAML was used at some point, but was dropped towards the end because it was too slow to use in the client library. To replace the IS we ended up with a work around which can be used in testing, but should be replaced in a proper system.
