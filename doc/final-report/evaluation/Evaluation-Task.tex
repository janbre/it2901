% was the task well enough described? Or would it have been better if the task was stricter and had more requirements?
Our task was very focused on research, and with that came a lot of freedom to choose which technologies to use, and to some degree what to actually implement. We did manage to settle on some requirements quite early, although most of them were not very strict. Even so, we felt this was not a problem and started designing, but in the later parts of the project we realized having such loose requirements might have led us to grasp over a bit much. Stricter prioritized requirements might have let us know what parts were more important than others, and we could have focused more on them. We realize we should have asked the customer for these stricter requirements on both what to use and what to implement.

Overall, the task has been very interesting, and we are in general very happy with it.
