\section{Testing}\label{Testing}
	This chapter will introduce our testing setup together with the result of our testing. We will start by introducing the testing suite, how the testing client works and we will also have a discussion about strengths and weaknesses of the system as a whole. Then we will introduce the actual tests and present our results. After reading this chapter it should be clear to you how to setup the testing suite, how to replicate our tests and you should have an in depth view of our results. The result section will also contain a discussion on the weaknesses which have had an effect on the tests and how we have interpreted our results despite this.
