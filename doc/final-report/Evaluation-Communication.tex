\indent \indent \textbf{Group communication} \\
% TODO: evaluate if the group communication has been perfect, and comment on the points where we have potential for improvement. 
The communication inside the team worked good, because we were working in the same room most of the time. This contributed to the prevention of conflicts. We also had some "Team building" that helped us not get on each others nerves. 
\\

\textbf{Supervisor communication} \\
% TODO: Write evaluation of the overall communicaion with the supervisor. 
The overall communication with the supervisor has been as expected. Some times there would have been nice with an answer to some of the emails about meetings. Typically we ask the supervisor for a meeting, decide time and place, and the supervisor doesn't confirm the meeting time, but he shows up so there is not really a problem. 
% TODO: Comment on the fact that the communication with the supervisor, regarding scrum, has not been optimal.
The communication with the supervisor has been as expected.

\textbf{Customer communication} \\
% FFI, lots of emails and very much good feedback. 
The communication with the customer went well. We had a lot of communication over email, and we had weekly meetings over Skype.
