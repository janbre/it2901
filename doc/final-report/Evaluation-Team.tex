    The problem we had with the roles in the group is that we did not manage to change up the roles during the project. This has resulted in some instances where we could not proceed with something because someone was ill. This was something that we were quite wary of in the beginning of the project, but we did not follow it up with the same care. Some of the reason behind this is that is was sometimes just easier to ask the person in charge to tell you about the parts that you did not know about. Another reason was that we worked together every day during the project which probably gave us the false confidence that we would not need to share the information. The few early roadblocks that we did encounter during the start up when we could have done something about it were probably so small that we just carried on without thinking about it.
