\section{Project Evaluation}\label{Project Evaluation}
    [This is the section where we evaluate the project and the past process.]
    
    \subsection{Task evaluation}
        % was the task well enough described? Or would it have been better if the task was stricter and had more requirements?
    
    \subsection{ the team organization }
        % the flat structure worked out well
        % we had no conflicts in the group. 
        % the task distribution that automatically happened 
        % some people had the unofficial responsibility for some tasks. Jan - IS, JÃ¸rgen - NS3, Ola - rooms, Magnus - Report, Stig - client. 
        % evaluate the work schedule - mon-thur/10-16. 
    \subsection{Planning}
        % how the beginning was
        % How we continued and adapted our planning
        % going from the daily documents to activity plans.
        % time estimation    
        % Activity plans - how they worked out. 
    \subsection{Methodology}
        % Scrum 
        % Agile
        % Did the metodology work for us?
        % Could we have adapted better to our methodology?
    \subsection{ Meetings }
        % What worked? 
        % What did not?
        % Supervisor meetings was kind of meaningless in the beginning. 
        % FFI meetings did occure frequently and smoothly. 
        % FFI meetings mostly gave us a good relationship with the customer. The actual information shared and the topics discussed would have been equally good or better discussed by email. 
    \subsection{Communication}
    
        \indent \indent \textbf{Group communication} \\
        % TODO: evaluate if the group communication has been perfect, and comment on the points where we have potential for improvement. 
        The communication inside the team worked good, because we were working in the same room most of the time. This contributed to the prevention of conflicts. We also had some "Team building" that helped us not get on each others nerves. 
        \\
        
        \textbf{Supervisor communication} \\
        % TODO: Write evaluation of the overall communicaion with the supervisor. 
        The overall communication with the supervisor has been as expected. Some times there would have been nice with an answer to some of the emails about meetings. Typically we ask the supervisor for a meeting, decide time and place, and the supervisor doesn't confirm the meeting time, but he shows up so there is not really a problem. 
        % TODO: Comment on the fact that the communication with the supervisor, regarding scrum, has not been optimal.
        The communication with the supervisor has been as expected. 
        \\ 
        
        \textbf{Customer communication} \\
        % FFI, lots of emails and very much good feedback. 
        The communication with the customer went well. We had a lot of communication over email, and we had weekly meetings over Skype. 
        \\
        
        
    \subsection{Design phase} - went smoothly, but did the design work out as we planned it?
        % the client side of the client documentation was not that good(?) 
    \subsection{Implementation phase}
        % we might have been a bit slow to get to the coding part but it worked out well(?). 
        % did we complete implementation on time?
        % did we have a lot of bugs in the end? 
    \subsection{Overall Summary}    
        % did we reach our goal?    
        % what went right? general impressions
        % what went bad? general impressions
        % What did we accomplish? 
        % What is missing and future work.
