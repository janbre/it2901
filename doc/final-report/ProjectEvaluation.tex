\section{Project Evaluation}\label{Project Evaluation}
    [This is the section where we evaluate the project and the process that we have had throughout.]
    
    % the team organization
        % the flat structure worked out well
        % we had no conflicts in the group. 
        % the task distribution that automatically happened 
            % some people had the unofficial responsibility for some tasks. Jan - IS, JÃ¸rgen - NS3, Ola - rooms, Magnus - Report, Stig - client. 
    % Planning
        % how the beginning was
        % How we continued and adapted our planning
        % going from the daily documents to activity plans.
        % time estimation    
        % Activity plans - how they worked out. 
    % Methodology
        % Scrum 
        % Agile
        % Did the metodology work for us?
        % Could we have adapted better to our methodology?
    % Meetings -  
        % What worked? 
        % What did not?
        % Supervisor meetings was kind of meaningless in the beginning. 
        % FFI meetings did occure frequently and smoothly. 
        % FFI meetings mostly gave us a good relationship with the customer. The actual information shared and the topics discussed would have been equally good or better discussed by email. 
    % Communication. 
        % Did we communicate.
        % FFI, lots of emails and very much good feedback. 
        % The communication inside the team worked good, becaus we were working in the same room most of the time. This contributed to the prevention of conflicts. We also had some "Team building" that helped us not get on each others nerves. 
    % Design phase - went smothly, but did the design work out as we planned it?
    % the client side of the client documentation was not that good(?) 
    % Implementation phase
        % we might have been a bit slow to get to the coding part but it worked out well(?). 
        % did we complete implementation on time?
        % did we have a lot of bugs in the end?
    % Results
        % discuss the results of the finished prototype and how well we get prioritized messages transmitted before other messages. 
    % The finished product. 
        % did we reach our goal? 
        % what went right? general impressions
        % what went bad? general impressions
        % What did we accomplish? 
        % What is missing and future work.
