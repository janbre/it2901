    % TODO: Write about changes to Server
    On the server side there has been a lot of changes to the design and implementation.
    
    The biggest change from early design to final design is probably the ThrottleMediator, before we started implementation we were very unsure of what we would be able to do in this mediator. So we wrote down a few things we wanted to try, most of which we managed to implement. We wanted to make it more dynamic, and maybe learn more from how long time data took to be sent to the different endpoints. Time was a limited resource, but we ended up making more out of it than what was initially anticipated.

    We also made some other changes to mediator design and implementation. We split up a couple of mediators to make them more specialized, and we changed the order of some mediators for better optimization.
