Our original design called for the implementation of the WSO2 Identity Server to handle the authentication of users and generation og SAML-tokens.
Our final implementation, does not use the Identity Server, but instead uses a mediator in the ESB. This means that clients cannot sign on to the system, user credentials are hard coded 

We had a single person working on the IS for two weeks while the rest of the group worked on gettig the rest of the code ready for the demonstration.
