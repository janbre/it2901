\section{Design and Implementation}\label{Design and Implementation}
	In this section we will discuss the design and implementation of the whole system. First off is the section about the client side of the system and then follows the server side. 
	
	Below is a first taste of how our system works. In Fig:\ref{fig:totaloverview} you can see a cloud of clients which can be on the same local network or be on different networks. The \textit{ESB} talks to \textit{GlassFish} where services are placed and clients talk to the ESB which mediates the message into GlassFish. In order for the ESB to know how much bandwidth each client can utilize, it is dependent on the \textit{Monitoring Service} which relays that sort of network information.

    \subsection{Changes}\label{Changes}
        There are a lot of changes from the initial prestudy design to the final design described in this chapter. The prestudy design did not go into a lot of detail because of limited knowledge about the systems we were to be using. Some of the assumptions we made proved to be wrong, and a lot of difficulties popped up along the way. We had a very long planning phase before the implementation in this project. Before we started the implementation we were much closer to the final design than we were in the prestudy, with only a few notable changes made during implementation. These changes are what we would like to discuss in this chapter. This discussion should help you get a better understanding of some of our discoveries, and maybe why we ended up with the product we now have.

    \subsubsection{Changes that affect both sides}\label{Changes:both}
\\\\
OpenSAML:\\
OpenSAML is not used at all. If we had succeeded in implementing the Identity Server, the IS would take care of all SAML generation. Since we use a dummy layer in the ESB to “simulate” the IS, the client needs to generate SAML, but it takes far too much time to initialize the OpenSAML libraries for it to be useful in our case, so we decided not to use it, and instead use Apache Axiom to build a proper SOAP-wrapped SAML-message based on some hardcoded strings, and variable roles and timestamps.
\\\\
Tokens:\\
The biggest change since the initial design finalization is how tokens are fetched and used in our implementation. The initial idea was that the server side would contain an identity server, which our client would identify itself towards. As it turned out, setting up and using the identity server was far more difficult than anticipated (see details on why below), and would have taken us far beyond our project deadline, so together with the customer it was decided that since this wasn't a part of the requirements for the project, it could be dropped. What we ended up with was a far simpler system where the client itself creates a token, which is then sent to a simple echo service on the server to get the SOAP headers we needed from it.\\

    \subsubsection{Regarding the Identity Server}\label{Changes:IS}
    
    Our original design called for the implementation of the WSO2 Identity Server, but our final product does not include it as we ran into some problems while trying to set it up. After discussing our situation with the customer, they agreed that we could drop it. It was, after all, not a functional requirement from their side, though it would be preferable to have it included.

    There are several reasons why we failed to implement the Identity Server, one of which is that we started our research of the IS too late, only two weeks before our prototype demonstration, and we only had one group member working on it. After seeing how well documented and fairly easy to use the WSO2 ESB was, we figured that the IS couldn't be much worse, but we figured wrong. Which leads us to the next source of our problems; the WSO2 Identity Server product page at \url{http://wso2.com/products/identity-server} is severely lacking in documentation. The user guide and administration manual contains barely no information about how to configure it and set it up to be usable in different usage scenarios. They provide links to some blog posts that employees had written back in 2009, and even though the blogs contained some useful information, and sometimes provided example configuration files and client code, they did not state which versions of the different products they were basing their examples on, so 
we don't know if there were compatibility problems between different versions of the IS and ESB.

    We used this blog post \url{http://blog.facilelogin.com/2009/05/accessing-proxy-services-in-wso2-esb.html} to try and set up communication between the IS and ESB. It was not entirely similar to our use case, as it uses X509 signing and encryption with HTTP transport, instead of using HTTPS and let the transport layer take care of security. When we tried to use the supplied client code and configuration files, we got some problems with the latter, as the client code would not accept them, throwing exceptions stating that they were not of the correct format, though the IS and the ESB accepted them. If we changed the configuration files so that the client would accept them (the only adjustment needed was to change the name of a tag in the WS-security policy XML-file, from \textless sp:Policy\textgreater\ to \textless wsp:policy\textgreater) then the IS and ESB would not accept them. Since it was just a minor adjustment, and the rest of the policy stayed identical, we don't believe this caused any problems, 
but it is an example of how frustrating it could be trying to use the code provided, as it was poorly commented and assumed one had previous knowledge of how Apache Axis2, Axiom, Rampart and Tomcat worked, since the WSO2 IS builds upon these products.

    After much trial and error, a lot of exceptions and googling for solutions, we managed to get the IS to issue security tokens and send them to the ESB, but the ESB failed in decrypting and verifying them. We were unable to figure out exactly why it failed, as the error message we got was that the ESB could not find the public key of the Identity Server, but using the Java keytool we could verify that the key was in fact present in the ESB key store. After spending quite a few hours trying different solutions, exporting the IS public key and importing it to the ESB key store under a new alias, importing the ESB public key into the IS key store etc. we gave up, as this specific use case was not the one we were after, and we had at least succeeded in getting the ESB and IS to talk to each other.

    Next, we tried configuring the IS to issue username tokens and send them over HTTPS, which would remove the need for endpoint encryption and was after all the use case we had in mind. We could find no specific examples for this scenario, so we tried creating our own security policy file, since the one from the previous example specified endpoint encryption, and adjusted the settings in the ESB and IS. In this way we managed to get the IS to create username tokens, but nothing more, as it crashed when trying to send it to the ESB, stating that the SOAP header did not include a security element. Monitoring the SOAP messages we could see that the header actually did contain this element, so we don't know why the IS couldn't find it.

    This was as far as we got before our prototype demonstration, and as already mentioned, our customer agreed that we could drop the Identity Server and instead use a dummy layer in the ESB. This means that our final product does not use the IS, and users cannot log on to the system because there is no user store, so the client will create static SAML-tokens which it sends to the dummy layer in the ESB, which then returns the same SAML-token, but wraps in in a SOAP message containing information about the clients priority in the system and its diffserv value.

    Had any of us had some experience with WS-security from before, and been familiar with the WS-security policy language, and the Axis2, Axiom, Rampart and Tomcat from Apache, which the WSO2 Identity Server builds upon,  we might have been more successful. We were quite frankly stumbling around in the dark, without knowing exactly where to begin.
